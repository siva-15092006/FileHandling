This Java project demonstrates basic file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files. The program allows users to choose between three file operations: reading the contents of a file, writing new content to a file, or appending content to an existing file. The file operations are implemented using Java’s built-in file handling classes such as BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and FileReader.

The project is designed to be interactive, with the user specifying the file name and selecting the operation they want to perform. This makes it a great starting point for anyone learning file handling in Java. The program is capable of reading and displaying file content, writing content to files, and appending new content to existing files.

Features Read File: Displays the content of a specified file to the console. Write File: Writes the content provided by the user to a specified file. If the file doesn’t exist, it is created. Modify File: Appends new content to an existing file, adding the new content on a new line. Error Handling: Proper error handling to notify the user in case of issues like file not found, access permissions, or IO errors. Tools and Libraries Used Java: The programming language used to implement the solution. BufferedReader: Used for reading files efficiently. BufferedWriter: Used for writing content to files. FileReader: Used to read files in character format. FileWriter: Used to write characters to files. Scanner: Used to take user input for file operations. How the Program Works The program works interactively through the console. Upon execution:

The user is prompted to enter the name of the file they want to interact with, including its extension (e.g., sample.txt). The user is then prompted to select an operation:

Read File: The program reads the file’s contents and displays it in the console.
Write File: The user enters content that will be written to the file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
Modify File: The user enters content to append to the file. The new content is added on a new line at the end of the file. Error messages are displayed if something goes wrong during the operation (e.g., file not found, IO exception).
